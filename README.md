> ***Video list auto playback made simple, specially built for RecyclerView***

## 0. Latest Version:  [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/eneim/Toro/toro/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/eneim/Toro/toro/_latestVersion)

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

## 1. Main features:

- Auto start media playback after RecyclerView layout has been settled down.
- Auto start/pause/resume media base on RecyclerView scroll state.
- Auto save latest media last playback position and resume from there later (*note: in Android default Media Player API, depend on Video's format and codec, the resume timestamp may varies*).
- Customizable playback behavior:
  - Customizable playback Strategy to decide the best component to start playback.
  - UI-based approach: you see the Video, then it can play. **Default**: you see 75% of the Video then it can start playing. **Advance**: you decide how much the visible Video should trigger the playback. See [Wiki](https://github.com/eneim/Toro/wiki) for more details.
  
- Powerful, flexible and highly customizable API. See [Wiki](https://github.com/eneim/Toro/wiki) for more details.

- Selective playback: among many playable items, Strategy helps find the best one to start playback.

- Extensions: ExoPlayer (v2, v1), (legacy) Android MediaPlayer API.

  - Toro Extended: extension based on ExoPlayer 2, provides the concept of "Next Player to play" (abstract concept for loop/auto scroll, ...), and long click/press handling. See Wiki for more information.

- **Lots of built-in components, but Toro is still highly customizable.**

**See [Wiki](https://github.com/eneim/Toro/wiki) for more details.**

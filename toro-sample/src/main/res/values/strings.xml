    Experiment: about what is coming to Toro

  <string name="experiment_description"><![CDATA[
    <p>This sample is the place I experiment the next features of Toro, but not be stable enough or even working.
    Some may be included in next version, some may not.</p>

    <p>It is not encourage to use it in production, but it is highly expected to have feedback as Github Issue.</p>

    This experiment includes:

    <ul>
      <li>Action button with various Add/Remove behaviours to verify how Toro works with Adapter#notify***</li>
      <li>Drag & drop to verify how Toro works with Adapter\'s data change in that case</li>
      <li>Click to open Single Player (portrait)</li>
    </ul>
    To be continued.
